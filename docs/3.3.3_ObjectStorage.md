## Introduction

Object Storage offers persistent storage for digital objects that can be files, databases or other datasets which need to be archived. Objects are stored in named locations known as containers. Containers can be nested thus objects can be stored hierarchically. This section explains how to easily use ObjectStorage in your widgets or operators via the JavaScript API provided.
