## Widget and Operator development

.fx: section-title

---
<!-- SLIDE 17 -->
## Widget and Operator development

Design principles of the widgets:

* Widgets are supposed to be small, reusable and user centric web applications
* Generic widgets are desirable
* Widgets should be adapted to real problems
* Widgets are mainly elements of the front-end layer. Widgets can access backend services directly
* During the development of widgets any technology accepted by web browsers (XHTML, JavaScript, SVG, Flash, applets ....) can be used

Widgets can be split up into three different components:

* **Descriptor (config.xml)**, which is a declarative description of the widget
* **Code**, composed of HTML, JavaScript and CSS files containing the definition and the behaviour of the widget
* **Static resources**, such as images, documentation and other static resources

---
<!-- SLIDE 18 -->
## Widget and Operator development

There are three types of operators:

* **Data sources operators:** Operators that provide information that can be consumed by other widgets/operators
* **Data targets operators:** Operators that are provided information and use it to do some tasks
* **Data transformation operators:** This type of operators can be very useful since they can transform data in order to make it usable by widgets or operators that expect data structure to be slightly different.

Operators use the same structure as widgets. The only difference is that the descriptor file (`config.xml`) does not link to an initial HTML document. Instead, it directly links to the list of javascript files.

---
<!-- SLIDE 19 -->
## JavaScript API

The JavaScript API allow Widgets and Operators to access the functionalities offered by the Application Mashup GE like widget/operator interconnection, state persistence, access to the cross-domain proxy, ...

---
<!-- SLIDE 20 -->
## JavaScript API
### MashupPlatform.http

`buildProxyURL`: Builds a URL suitable for working around the cross-domain problem.

	!javascript
	MashupPlatform.http.buildProxyURL(url, options)

* `url` is the target URL
* `options` is an object with request options

`makeRequest`: Sends a HTTP request.

	!javascript
	MashupPlatform.http.makeRequest(url, options)

* `url` is the URL to which to send the request
* `options` is an object with a list of request options

* `request options`
	* General options
  	* Callback options

---
<!-- SLIDE 21 -->
## JavaScript API
### MashupPlatform.http

* `request options`
  	* General options:

		* `contentType` (String): The Content-Type header for your request. If it is not provided, the content-type header will be extrapolated from the value of the `postBody` option
		* `encoding` (String; default UTF-8): The encoding for the contents of your request. It is best left as-is, but should weird encoding issues arise, you may have to tweak this
		* `method` (String; default POST): The HTTP method to use for the request
		* `responseType` (String; default: ""): Can be set to change the response type
		* `parameters` (Object): The parameters for the request, which will be encoded into the URL for a GET method, or into the request body when using the PUT and POST methods

---
<!-- SLIDE 22 -->
## JavaScript API
### MashupPlatform.http

* **request options**
  	* More general options:

		* `postBody` (ArrayBufferView, Blob, Document, String, FormData): The contents to use as request body (usually used in POST and PUT requests)
		* `requestHeaders` (Object): A set of key-value pairs, with properties representing header names
		* `forceProxy` (Boolean; default false): Sends the request through the proxy regardless of the other options passed
		* `context` (Object; default null): The value to be passed as the this parameter to the callbacks. If context is null the this parameter of the callbacks is left intact

---
<!-- SLIDE 23 -->
## JavaScript API
### MashupPlatform.http

* **request options**
  	* Callback options:
		* `onSuccess`: Invoked when a request completes and its status code belongs in the 2xy family. This is skipped if a code-specific callback is defined, and happens before `onComplete`. Receives the response object as the first argument
		* `onFailure`: Invoked when a request completes and its status code exists but is not in the 2xy family. This is skipped if a code-specific callback is defined, and happens before `onComplete`. Receives the response object as the first argument
		* `onXYZ` (with XYZ representing any HTTP status code): Invoked just after the response is complete if the status code is the exact code used in the callback name. Prevents execution of onSuccess and `onFailure`. Happens before `onComplete`. Receives the response object as the first argument

---
<!-- SLIDE 24 -->
## JavaScript API
### MashupPlatform.http

* **request options**
  	* More callback options:

		* `onComplete`: Triggered at the very end of a request's life-cycle, after the request completes, status-specific callbacks are called, and possible automatic behaviours are processed. Guaranteed to run regardless of what happened during the request. Receives the response object as the first argument
		* `onException`: Triggered whenever an exception arises running any of the `onXYZ`, `onSuccess`, `onFailure` and `onComplete` callbacks. Receives the request as the first argument, and the exception object as the second one

---
<!-- SLIDE 25 -->
## JavaScript API
### MashupPlatform.http

* **response object**
	* `request` (Request): The request for the current response
	* `status` (Number): The status of the response to the request. This is the HTTP result code
	* `statusText` (String): The response string returned by the HTTP server. Unlike status, this includes the entire text of the response message
	* `response` (ArrayBuffer, Blob, String): The response entity body according to responseType, as an ArrayBuffer, Blob or String. This is null if the request is not complete, was not successful or the responseType option of the requests was ""
	* **responseText (String):** The response to the request as text, or null if the request was unsuccessful or the responseType option of the requests was different to ""

---
<!-- SLIDE 26 -->
## JavaScript API
### MashupPlatform.log

Object containing the following constants:

* **ERROR:** Used for indicating an Error level
* **WARN:** Used for indicating a Warning level
* **INFO:** Used for indicating an Info level
