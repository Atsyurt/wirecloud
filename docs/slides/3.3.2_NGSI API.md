## Introduction

This document is the reference documentation of the NGSI API provided by WireCloud. For being able to use this API you have to add a requirement on this API thought the description file of the widget/operator.

## Data types used by the library

.fx: section-title

---
<!-- SLIDE 5 -->
## Data types used by the library

* **Entity** is defined as an object composed of the following fields:
	* `id`: string with the id of the entity
	* `isPattern`: boolean indicating whether the id field contains a regular expression pattern. *(Optional)*
	* `type`: type of the **Entity**. *(Optional field)*

* **Attribute** is defined as an object composed of the following fields:
	* `name`: name of the attribute
	* `type`: type of the **Attribute**. *(Optional field)*

* **Duration** describe time intervals and defined as a string.

---
<!-- SLIDE 6 -->
## Data types used by the library

* **Condition** declare the condition that will trigger notifications. This type is defined as an object composed of the following fields:
	* `type`: string containing `ONTIMEINTERVAL` or `ONCHANGE`
	* `values`: array of string. Depends on the value of the type field:
		* `ONTIMEINTERVAL`: exactly one value SHALL be present and SHALL represent the time interval between notifications
		* `ONCHANGE`: this element SHALL contain the name(s) of the Context Attributes to be monitored for changes

* **MetadataValue** type is used to assign metadata to attributes. This type is defined as an object composed of the following fields:
	* `name` is the name of the attribute metadata
	* `type` is the type of the attribute metadata
	* `value` is the value to assign to the attribute metadata

---
<!-- SLIDE 7 -->
## Data types used by the library

* **AttributeValue** type is used to assign values to attributes. This type is defined as an object composed of the following fields:
	* `name` is the name of the attribute
	* `type` is the type of the attribute. *(Optional field)*
	* `contextValue` is the value to assign to the attribute
	* `metadata` is the metadata associated with the attribute. This field is defined as a **MetadataValue** array

* **AttributeUpdate** type is used to describe a context update. This type is defined as an object composed of the following fields:
	* `entity` is the entity affected by the update. This field is defined as an **Entity** array
	* `attributes` is the new values for the attributes of the entity. This field is defined as an **AttributeValue** array

---
<!-- SLIDE 8 -->
## Data types used by the library

* **AttributeDeletion** type is used to describe the deletion of attributes from an entity. This type is defined as an object composed of the following fields:
	* `entity` is the entity affected by the update. This field is defined as an **Entity** array
	* `attributes` is the new values for the attributes of the entity. This field is defined as an **AttributeValue** array

## NGSI.Connection

.fx: section-title

---

## NGSI.Connection
<!-- SLIDE 10 -->
A new NGSI.Connection can be instantiated using the following constructor:

	!javascript
	NGSI.Connection(url[, options])

* `url` (String): is the url of the Orion Pub/Sub Context Broker instance
* `options` (Object; default null): This parameter may be null if no extra option is needed. Current supported options are:
	* `ngsi_proxy_url` (String; default null): URL of the NGSI proxy used for subscriptions
	* `request_headers` (Object; default null): A set of key-value pairs, with properties representing header names. These extra headers will be use when making request to the context broker
	* `use_user_fiware_token` (Boolean; default: false): Use current user authentication token retrieved from the IdM system

---
<!-- SLIDE 11 -->
## NGSI.Connection

All the method of **NGSI.Connection** support at least the following callbacks:

* `onSuccess` is called when the request finishes successfully
* `onFailure` is called when the request finish with errors
* `onComplete` is called when the request finish regardless of whether the request is successful or not

---

## NGSI.Connection
### createRegistration
<!-- SLIDE 12 -->
Register context information (entities and attributes) in the NGSI server

	!javascript
	createRegistration(entities, attributes, duration, providingApplication[, options])

* `entities` is the list of **Entities** that are going to be registered
* `attributes` is a list of the **Attributes** that are going to be assigned to the previous list of entities

<!-- SLIDE 17 -->
## NGSI.Connection
### query

The `query` method supports other extra options:

* `flat` (Boolean; default: false): This options is used for simplifying the data structure used for representing the returned data
* `limit` (Number; default: 20): This option allow you to specify the maximum number of entities you want to receive from the server
* `offset` (Number; default: 0): Allows you to skip a given number of elements at the beginning
* `details` (Boolean; default: false): Makes the server return more detailed information about the request

---
<!-- SLIDE 18 -->
## NGSI.Connection
### query

This is the value of the data parameter passed to the `onSuccess` callback when using the `flat` is `false`:

	!javascript
	[
		{
			"entity": {
				"id": "van1",
				"type": "Van"
			},
			"attributes": [
				{
					"name": "current_position",
					"type": "coordinates",
					"contextValue": "43.47557, -3.8048315",

### updateAttributes

Update context information.

	!javascript
	updateAttributes(update[, options])

* `update` a list of **AttributeUpdates**

---
<!-- SLIDE 21 -->
## NGSI.Connection
### addAttributes

Add/update entity attributes. This operation will create the attribute on those entities where they doesn't exist. In addition to this, this operation will also create entities if they doesn't exist.

	!javascript
	addAttributes(toAdd[, options])

## NGSI.Connection
### createSubscription

Subscribe to changes in the context information.

	!javascript
	createSubscription(entities, attributeNames, duration, throttling, conditions, options)

* `entities` is the list of **Entities** to query in this subscription
* `attributeNames` is the list of attribute names to query in this subscription.
  Use `null` for retrieving all the attributes
* `duration` is the **Duration** of this subscription

  value must be provided using the **Duration** type. You can also pass `null`
  if you don't want to provide a throttling value
* `conditions` is a list of **Conditions** that will trigger queries using the
  provided information and their subsequent notifications to the `onNotify`
  callback

---
<!-- SLIDE 24 -->
## NGSI.Connection
### createSubscription

This method, supports a new type of callback: `onNotify`. This callback is
required and can be either an URL or a function. In the later case, the NGSI
Connection must be created using a NGSI proxy and will be called every time a
notification comes from the NGSI server.

The first parameter of a `onNotify` callback function will be an object with the
response data.

In addition to this, the `createSubscription` method supports an extra option:

* `flat` (Boolean; default: false): This options is used for simplifying the
  data structure used for representing the returned data

---
<!-- SLIDE 25 -->
## NGSI.Connection
### updateSubscription

Update context subscription.

	!javascript
	updateSubscription(subId, duration, throttling, conditions[, options])

* `subId` is the id of the context subscription to cancel
* `duration` is the **Duration** of this subscription
* `throttling` is the proposed minimum interval between notifications. This
  value must be provided using the **Duration** type. `null` is also valid
* `conditions` is a list of **Conditions** that will trigger queries using the
  provided information and their subsequent notifications to the `onNotify`
  callback

---
<!-- SLIDE 26 -->
## NGSI.Connection
### cancelSubscription

Cancels or deletes context subscription.

	!javascript
	cancelSubscription (subId[, options])

* `subId` is the id of the context subscription to cancel
