Gadget development documentation
================================

Gadgets are formed by three different components:

* Template, which is a declarative description of the gadget, and represents its
  main entry point. This file contains, among other things, references to the
  rest of resources of a gadget.
* Code, composed of HTML, JavaScript and CSS files containing the definition and
  the behaviour of the gadget.
* Static resources, such as images, documentation and other static resources.

Design principles
-----------------

Before starting the creation of a gadget, the developer should be aware of
certain design principles of the gadgets:

* Gadgets are supposed to be small, reusable and user centric web applications.
* Generic gadgets are desirable, but ad-hoc solutions are allowed too if they
  are quick and cheap enough.
* Gadgets should be adapted to real problems.
* Gadgets are elements of the front-end layer (View). It's not desirable for
  gadgets to perform back-end layer functions (controller or model) because they
  can be provided by the platform (persistent state).
* During the development of gadgets any technology accepted by web browsers
  (XHTML, JavaScript, SVG, Flash, applets ....) can be used.
