Widget Template
===============

A Widget Template is a document that defines and provides information about
the widget and its behavior within its environment (user, platform, other widgets
...). Moreover, it is possible to define several templates each of them
parametrizing the behaviour of the widget in different ways.

These widget templates can be provided using different languages. Currently,
Wirecloud support two languages: one based on plain XML and another based on RDF.
