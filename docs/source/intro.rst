Introduction
============

Wirecloud is a widget mashup platform that enables the user to both create and manage **wired web mashups**. Web mashups integrate heterogeneous data, application logic, and UI components (widgets/gadgets) sourced from the Web to create new coherent and value-adding composite applications. 

Some of the Wirecloud's key features are:

* Innovate through experimentation by choosing the best suited widgets and prefab mashup-lets for your devised mashup from a vast, ever-growing distributed catalogue.

* The wiring editor allows you to easily connect widgets in a mashup to create a full-fledged dashboard with RIA functionality.

* The piping editor allows you to easily connect widgets to back-end services or data sources through an extendable set of operators, including filters, aggregators, adapters, etc.

* Sharing your newly created mashup with other colleagues and users. Comment it, tag it and rate it to foster discoverability and shareability.

* Help to build a strong community by commenting, tagging and rating others' widgets, operators and mashups. The platform will also do its best to complement your contribution.  

Wirecloud is a fork from the `EzWeb project`_.
