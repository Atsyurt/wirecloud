------------------
- Initial version after the fork from EzWeb to wirecloud
- The main differences from the EzWeb project are:
   - Configurable workspaces
   - Different theme infrastructures: we have removed
     the layout application and now the user can not
     change the appearance. Yes, we have removed this
     feature.
   - Speed improvements
   - Selenium functional tests for the core features
   - Optimize the gadget template processing
   - Initial docs in Sphinx format. They are work in
     progress, don't expect anything useful yet.
